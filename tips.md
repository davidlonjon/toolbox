### Scripts shebang

In all bash script use the following shebang:
```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
```
because it helps for portability [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10376206/preferred-bash-shebang](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10376206/preferred-bash-shebang)

### Scripts file extension

For scripts, it is prefered to use .sh or .rb extensions so it is easier to batch manipulate them later
